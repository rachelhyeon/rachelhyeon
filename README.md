- 👋 Hi, I’m @rachelhyeon

My areas of expertise are building interactive dashboards that display insights in data, engineering end-to-end data pipelines and improving machine learning models through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. I enjoy experimenting with different software to improve existing workflows and finding ways to make complex processes simpler.

At Allegheny County Department of Human Services, I had the opportunity to publish two public-facing dashboards related to mental health crisis response system in Allegheny County. The dashboards are viewable using the links below.
• [Mental Health Crisis Service Trends in Allegheny County](https://alleghenycountyanalytics.us/2025/01/02/mental-health-crisis-service-trends-interactive-dashboard/) 
• [Alternative Response Initiative](https://analytics.alleghenycounty.us/2025/12/22/alternative-response-initiative-interactive-dashboard/)

I also enjoy programming, learning about technology and practicing Vim motions in my spare time.
